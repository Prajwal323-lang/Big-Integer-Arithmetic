# Big-Integer-Arithmetic
Project Overview
This project implements arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic in C, allowing calculations with numbers far beyond the limits of native data types (up to 309 digits). It handles addition, subtraction, and multiplication with proper sign management and boundary checks, making it useful for applications requiring high-precision computations (e.g., cryptography, financial systems, and scientific computing).

Key Features
Arbitrary-Precision Operations

Supports extremely large integers (up to 10³⁰⁹) using string-based storage.

Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication without overflow.

Signed Number Support

Correctly processes negative numbers and ensures valid sign handling in results.

Boundary Validation

Checks if numbers are within predefined bounds (MAX_NUMBER and MIN_NUMBER).

Prevents out-of-range results in arithmetic operations.

Efficient Algorithms

Uses digit-wise processing with carry/borrow propagation.

Optimized with string reversal for easier computation.

How It Works
Input Handling

Numbers are stored as strings to avoid 64-bit integer limitations.

Leading/trailing zeros and negative signs are properly managed.

Arithmetic Operations

Addition: Digit-by-digit summation with carry handling.

Subtraction: Borrow propagation with sign correction.

Multiplication: Efficient digit-pair products with summation.

Bounds Checking

Before and after operations, numbers are verified against MAX_NUMBER and MIN_NUMBER.

Performance Considerations
Time Complexity:

Addition/Subtraction: O(n) (where n = max digits).

Multiplication: O(n²) (due to nested digit loops).

Space Complexity: O(n) (stored as strings).
